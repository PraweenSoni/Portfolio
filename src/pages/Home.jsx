          Hi! I'm final-year <span>B.Sc. Computer Applications student at DSPMU, Ranchi</span>. I have a passion for <span>full stack web development</span>, specializing in both front-end and back-end technologies. I enjoy creating functional, user-friendly websites.
          <br /> <br />
          Beyond web development, I'm constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my skills. I'm also interested in working on <span>IoT projects</span>, combining technology with innovation to solve real-world problems. Currently I haven't worked on paid projects, but I've created some projects that include <span>responsive Designs</span> and <span>creative web interface</span>.
          <br /> <br />
          So, <span>Welcome to my portfolio</span>, where I showcase my <span>skills</span>, <span>projects</span>, and growth in web development and IoT!
          <br /> <br />
          Explore my portfolio, <br />
          <span>Thank You ðŸ™‚!</span>
